# Repository Setup Instructions

## Setting Up Your GitHub Repository Icon/Image

### ‚úÖ What we've done:
1. **Added icon to README**: Your repository now shows the AI Voice Proxy icon at the top of the README
2. **Created a social preview image**: A professional social media preview image is ready at `.github/repository-social-image.svg`

### üöÄ Next Steps (Manual GitHub Setup):

#### 1. Upload Social Preview Image
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/Adarshvk98/ai-voice-proxy`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Social preview** section
4. Click **Upload an image**
5. Upload the file: `.github/repository-social-image.svg` (or convert to PNG first if needed)

#### 2. Add Repository Topics
In your repository settings, add these topics to make it more discoverable:
```
ai, voice-cloning, voice-proxy, typescript, nodejs, whisper, ollama, tts, real-time, video-calls, microsoft-teams, zoom, slack, speech-recognition, text-to-speech, websocket
```

#### 3. Update Repository Description
Set this as your repository description:
```
üéôÔ∏è Real-time AI voice proxy for video calls - Clone your voice, enhance speech with AI, output to virtual microphone. Works with Teams, Zoom, Slack. 100% local processing.
```

#### 4. Convert SVG to PNG (Optional, for better compatibility)
If GitHub doesn't accept the SVG, convert it to PNG:
- Use online converter: https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
- Or install ImageMagick: `brew install imagemagick`
- Then run: `convert .github/repository-social-image.svg .github/repository-social-image.png`

### üì± Result:
- ‚úÖ Repository will show your icon in README
- ‚úÖ Social media shares will show professional preview image
- ‚úÖ Repository will be more discoverable with proper topics
- ‚úÖ Clear, engaging description for visitors

The icon is now prominently displayed in your README and you have a professional social preview image ready to upload!
